# RegressionWithKeras
 
 Using the concrete dataset on 
 <href>https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DL0101EN/labs/data/concrete_data.csv</href>
 building four regression model with Keras and comparing the error change of them.
 
 Part A - Building a neural network with one hidden layer of 10 nodes and ReLU as activation function using adam optimizer and mean squared error as loss function.
 
 1. Randomly splitting the data into a training and test sets by holding 30% of the data for testing
 
 2. Train the model with 50 epochs
 
 3. Evaluate the model on test data and compute mean squared error
 
 4. Repeat these steps 50 times
 
 5. Print MSE and standard deviation of these 50 errors.
 
 Part B - Do the same with A but normalize the data
 
 Part C - Repeat Part B with 100 epochs
 
 Part D - Repeat B with three hidden layers each of 10 nodes and ReLU as activation function.
